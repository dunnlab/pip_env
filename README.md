# My Python Project

## Motivations and Goals

Observation, question. Ways I seek to answer are 

- [x] start this repo
- [ ] goal 2 (see issue #4)
- [ ] goal 3

## Python Environment

This project uses a Python [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). The environment contents are documented in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file. You can (re)generate the virtual environment by running the script [`setup_venv.sh`](setup_venv.sh). To use this environment, run the following before executing any python scripts from this repo.

``` bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
